While pursuing a full-time freelance career in recipe development, food tech product strategy and content strategy, I completed Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree, a four month certification that taught me the fundamentals of web development in a project-based, self-paced format, including:

- Database technologies like SQL, NoSQL and ORM frameworks
-  Server-side technologies including auth, identity management and REST APIs
- Client-side technologies including CSS, HTML and JS-based web frameworks
- Modern devops, server deployment, CI/CD pipelines and containerization
