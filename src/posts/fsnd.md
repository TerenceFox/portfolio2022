While pursuing a full-time freelance career in recipe development, food tech product strategy and content strategy, I completed Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree, a four month certification that taught me the fundamentals of web development in a project-based, self-paced format, including:

- SQL and ORM data modeling
- REST APIs and server-side web frameworks
- Authentication/authorization flows and identity access management
- CSS, HTML and Javascript-based client-side web frameworks
- Modern devops, server deployment, CI/CD pipelines and containerization
