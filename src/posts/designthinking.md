This program teaches human-centered design skills in a six-week course, culminating with a day-long hands-on workshop. I learned how to participate in and conduct exercises that facilitate each step of the design process. Design thinking has been an integral part of my work practices as a repeatable, reliable way to find solutions to business problems.
