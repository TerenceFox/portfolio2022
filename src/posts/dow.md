Under a digital transformation initiative at Dow Chemical, I helped build an application to help material scientists leverage a database of Dow material science IP to design tests and develop new material recipes, taking the concept from a simple proof of concept to a 1.0 release.

- I worked closely with client stakeholders, including a group of material scientists who were able to test out alpha version of the app and provide feedback.
- Took on a lead front end role within the team, helping to interview & onboard new developers, review code in pull requests, and gather requirements from the business
- Contributed to all parts of the tech stack, helping to build new API endpoints and set up Azure DevOps pipelines for multiple environments in addition to the front end code
