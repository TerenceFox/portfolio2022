On this project, I was responsible for maintenance and support for a portfolio of 50+ custom web applications used by Mt. Sinai employees. In addition to handling support tickets, providing regular maintenance and addressing bug reports, my team was also responsible for a backlog of new feature requests. I gained familiarity with: 

- On-premise Linux-based server infrastructure
- Managing high-availability services 
- Adding enhancements to and fixing bugs for legacy codebases
