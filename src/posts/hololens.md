Early in the pandemic, I was involved in a [volunteer effort](https://www.avanade.com/en-us/clients/ventilator-challenge-uk) to rapidly convert manufacturing capacity in the UK to the production of ventilators to meet the unanticipated demand caused by COVID-19. Our team worked around the clock across five time zones to convert diagrams and instruction manuals into Dynamics 365 Hololens guides. This allowed technicians on factory floors to quickly learn new processes by wearing a mixed reality headset that guided them through each step.
