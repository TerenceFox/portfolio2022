Early in the pandemic, I contributed to a [effort](https://www.avanade.com/en-us/clients/ventilator-challenge-uk) to rapidly convert manufacturing capacity in the UK to the production of ventilators to meet the unanticipated demand caused by COVID-19.
- Our team worked around the clock across five time zones to convert diagrams and instruction manuals into Dynamics 365 Hololens guides.
- Allowed technicians on factory floors to quickly learn new manufacturing processes by wearing a mixed reality headset that guided them through each step.
