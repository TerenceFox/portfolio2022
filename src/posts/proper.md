This prototype allowed Proper, a curated database of THC and CBD products,  to evaluate a third-party technology through their existing network of "experts", minimizing risk and disruption to the core product or user experience.

I built a standalone application using the MERN stack that allowed a group of beta testers to evaluate the effectiveness of the Google Cloud Vision API to recognize products from user-submitted photos, leveraging their exisitng database of product photography. The testers would upload a photo of a known product and the application would return a ranked list of possible matches. The tester could report which product, if any, matched the photo. We then leveraged MongoDB's backend reporting tools to analyze the results.
