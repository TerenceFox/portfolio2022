At Fidelity, I contributed to the development of a new desktop experience for their associates based on the Glue42 desktop integration platform. In addition to building out standalone Angular applications, we also created a common library of UX components that adhered to Fidelity's new design system.

- Worked with client stakeholders to gather requirements and ensure that client code quality standards would be met prior to handoff
- Contributed UX engineering to several applications that included integrations with both internal APIs and the local API for the desktop integration platform
- Contributed to devops efforts to publish libraries to an internal NPM registry as well as CI/CD pipelines for deploying applications to several environments
