At Fidelity, I contributed to the development of a new desktop experience for their associates based on the Glue42 desktop integration platform. This platform opens web applications as Electron desktop windows, providing custom workflows that can be centrally packaged and managed. In addition to building out standalone Angular applications, we also created a common library of UX components, adhering to Fidelity's new design system, that could be re-used company-wide. 

- Helped build a library of Angular components that could be consumed as a package by other applications, working closely with product owners and the client's UX team to follow their design syste
- Worked with client stakeholders to gather requirements and ensure that client code quality standards would be met prior to handoff
- Contributed UX engineering to several applications that included integrations with both internal APIs and the local API for the desktop integration platform
- Contributed to devop efforts to provide the component library as an NPM package within their internal registry as well as deploy applications to multiple environments, helping to troubleshoot Jenkins pipelines and Docker images
