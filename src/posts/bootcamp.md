While at Avanade, I helped create and instruct two four-week bootcamps to help teach Angular and React to developers. They included four lectures on the basics of each framework and an all-day hands-on workshop with the goal of building a sample application that touched on most aspects of the frameworks.  Each bootcamp covered:
- Composition and thinking in components
- State management
- Strategies for styling and static asset management
- HTTP requests and working with REST APIs
- Authentication and authorization
- Server deployment

Each class saw 50-60 developers completing the project with many using it as a springboard for project work using these frameworks.
