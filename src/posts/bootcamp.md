I helped create and instruct two four-week boot camps to teach Angular and React to developers. They included four lectures on the basics of each framework and an all-day hands-on workshop with the goal of building a sample application that touched on most aspects of the frameworks.
- Each class saw 50-60 developers completing the project, with many using it as a springboard for project work using these frameworks
- Developers finished the course with a fully functional client-side application with API calls, custom styling, state management, forms and third-party library integrations
