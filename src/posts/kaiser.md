For Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest nonprofit healthcare systems in the US, I worked with a hybrid on-shore/off-shore health care team to develop an application to use in two of the company's customer service centers in California. During this project I focused on UX engineering, working on the Angular front end of the application.
