Kennedy Children Center is a nonprofit education organization that operates two pre-schools that serves children with developmental delays from low-income backgrounds. This project provided them with an easily accessible, always up-to-date source of documentation, forms and policies for their staff.  

It is a standalone Wordpress site with custom plugins that provide wiki functionality, like automatic linking, tags and categories for organizing posts, and deployed to a Linode VM. Wordpress allows non-technical team members at KCC to make new posts and updates as needed.
